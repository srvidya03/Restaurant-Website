## Instructions on how to get working on website


### How to get the most recent code everytime before you begin your task:
1)type "git pull" in the terminal, when you are in the C:\ ... \RestaurantRecommendation directory
### How to get the website to run:
I think you have to download node and react onto your computer

You can check if you have node by typing "node -v", you can check if you have react by typing "npm -v"

1)change your directory in the terminal to C:\ ... \RestaurantRecommendation\Project 0\backend

2)start the backend (node.js and express) by typing "nodemon server" into the terminal

3)you can type "localhost:5000/api/v1/restaurants" into your browser to see the data in our database, or login to our MongoDB page to look at it (username:cesarg7@csu.fullerton.edu password:Zammy7230!)


If local host webpage looks like a giant paragraph that makes no sense, then you might need to download a json viewer extension for whatever browser you are using. I use google chrome and I had to download JSONVue extension

4)change your directory in the terminal to C:\ ... \RestaurantRecommendation\Project 0\frontend

5)start the frontend (React) type "npm start" into the terminal, The react app will pop up a tab for you in the browser that is our website

### Before you start working on your task:
1)type "git branch task01" into terminal, to create a branch called task01 (or call it whatever you want), that is the exact copy of the master branch

2)type "git checkout task01" into terminal, this will switch you to the task01 branch

3)add/edit/delete whatever code for whatever task your doing

4)do git add, git commit, and git push to add the code on the branch

5)Product owner or yourself can go on the GitHub website

click comparse and 

click "","Confirm Merge", "Delete branch"

This will add the task01 branch code to the master branch so everyone can get the new code
